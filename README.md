My name is Matt Thommes. I am a husband, father, and software application developer from Roselle, IL. I work both in downtown Chicago as well as from home occasionally.

I love writing code and scripts that automate or simplify my life. I use API’s to create custom interfaces to services that provide a value to me; that is, save me time, effort, or allow me to explore a new approach to a common problem or redundancy.

I believe in an automated, social, and integrated web - but I also cherish the intrinsic nature of humans which can’t be controlled nor fully revealed via bots and digital bits. True relationships and meaning come from our purist, selfless forms.
